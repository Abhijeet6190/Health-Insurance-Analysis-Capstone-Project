# Health-Insurance-Analysis-Capstone-Project

### Problem Statement:
A significant public health concern is the rising cost of healthcare. Therefore, it's crucial
to be able to predict future costs and gain a solid understanding of their causes. The
insurance industry must also take this analysis seriously. This analysis may be used by
healthcare insurance providers to make a variety of strategic and tactical decisions.

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict patients’ healthcare costs and to identify factors
contributing to this prediction. It will also be useful to learn the interdependencies of
different factors and comprehend the significance of various tools at various stages of
the healthcare cost prediction process.

### Case scenario:
Estimate the cost of hospitalization for Christopher, Ms. Jayna (her date of birth is
12/28/1988, height is 170 cm, and weight is 85 kgs). She lives in a tier 1 city and her state’s
